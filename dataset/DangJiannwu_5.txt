Investigation of coarticulation in continuous
speech of Japanese

Issue Date 2004-09-01

Abstract: This study analyzed coarticulation involved in continuous speech based on articulographic
data obtained from three Japanese male speakers. Distribution of the articulation points of
vowels and consonants revealed that speakers might compensate for morphological differences in the
hard palate by adjusting the location of vowel articulation points. To evaluate the effects of the left and
right phonemes on the target phoneme, three-phoneme sequences, consisting of five Japanese vowels
(V) and ten apical and two palatal consonants (C), were extracted from read sentences and used in this
analysis. A stepwise multiple regression method was used to analyze the phoneme sequences, in order
to evaluate the eecontributionsff of the surrounding phonemes to the central one. The results showed
that the horizontal component of the articulatory movement had a dominant function during
articulation. The movement of the tongue tip was highly correlated to the tongue dorsum movement in
the horizontal dimension, but was almost independent in the vertical dimension. This phenomenon
suggested that coarticulation in VCV sequences can be considered as an independent consonantal
gesture superimposed on a transitional portion between vowels. For apical-vowel combinations, the
preceding consonant in CVC had a stronger effect on the vowel than the following one, but there was
no dominance caused by the positions of the vowels in VCV sequences. For palatal-vowel
combinations, the following phoneme showed a greater effect than the preceding phoneme in CVC
sequences. In VCV sequences, the open and closed vowels showed different behaviors.

1. INTRODUCTION
Coarticulation is a natural phenomenon found in human
speech, and is affected both at the physiological level by
the properties of the speech organs, and in the motor
planning stage by the look-ahead mechanism. Coarticulation
generates the characteristics of natural sounding
speech, and at the same time introduces so-called suprasegmental
characteristics that degenerate phonemic boundaries.
It is therefore a crucial issue in both speech
synthesis and speech recognition to deal with coarticulation
when performing human speech behaviors.
In general, there are two types of coarticulatory
overlaps occurring during natural speech: the left-to-right
(LR, carryover) and right-to-left (RL, anticipatory). The
former reflects the sequence as the tongue, mandible, and
lips move from the preceding phoneme toward the
following one. In this case, the target of this phoneme is
reached in different ways, depending on the status of the
previous phoneme. Anticipatory (RL) coarticulation can
occur only if the speaker can eelook aheadff in time and
anticipate oncoming sounds. While LR coarticulation
occurs at the physiological level, RL coarticulation reflects
a high-level (central) type of phonological-phonetic processing,
since an entire segment must be scanned before it is
articulated [1]. To describe this process, Henke proposed a
phonemic-segment model [2]. Each segment with multiple
phonemes was described in a matrix of articulatory target
features, in which some features change abruptly as the
targets vary from one to another.

consonants (C) and five vowels (V) were employed [3]. He
concluded that VCV articulation could be represented by a
basic diphthongal gesture with an independent consonantal
gesture superimposed on its transitional portion. Kiritani
observed articulatory movements for a Japanese speaker
using the X-ray microbeam system and investigated
coarticulation in VCV and CVC sequences within a carry
sentence [4]. He found that in CVC, the effect of the
preceding consonant on the vowel articulation was larger
than that of the following one, regardless of the vowel
types, while the following vowels in VCV sequences
showed larger effects than the preceding ones. Recasens et
al. employed electropalatographic data and the trajectory
of the second formant to investigate anticipatory and
carryover effects within VCV sequences, consisting of
seven consonants and two vowels /a/ and /i/ [5]. They
found that the effects were dependent on the degree of
articulatory constraint (DAC) of two adjacent phonemes,
where the DAC was defined as having three levels. They
also tried to model coarticulation between the consonants
and vowels using the DAC.
The dynamic characteristics of the speech organs have
been observed using X-ray cinematography, X-ray microbeam
system, and electromagnetic sensing systems, in
order to systematically analyze and model speech production
mechanisms. Shirai and Honda, for example, analyzed
X-ray data obtained from five Japanese male speakers, and
built a statistical model with five parameters, including the
jaw and tongue [6]. Maeda analyzed articulatory movements
obtained from an X-ray film of a French female
speaker and constructed a statistical articulatory model
with eight parameters [7]. Dang and Honda have developed
a physiological articulatory model with a target-based
control strategy [8?10]. The model was constructed based
on volumetric MR images and anatomic data, and is driven
by physiological mechanisms. The model is expected to
naturally realize the coarticulation caused by physiological
factors. However, the coarticulation derived from highlevel
processing, such as anticipation in the target planning
stage, has not yet been taken into account since there is
insufficient knowledge for quantifying such effects.
In this study, we attempt to clarify and quantify the
coarticulation involved in continuous speech based on
articulatory data obtained from the electromagnetic articulographic
system. Distribution of the articulatory points is
first investigated for vowels and consonants, to obtain a
uniform articulatory coordinate. We then evaluate contributions
of observation points to a target phoneme using a
stepwise multiple regression analysis. Finally, we investigate
the anticipatory (RL) and carryover (LR) effects of
the coarticulation separately by measuring changes in the
tongue shapes that resulted from the left and right
phonemes.
2. ARTICULATORY DATA AND LABELING
The articulatory data used in this study were collected
using the electromagnetic articulographic (EMA) system at
NTT Communication Science Laboratories, Japan [11].
Figure 1 shows the placement of the receiver coils in the
experiment. Four receiver coils were placed on the tongue
surface in the midsagittal plane, from the tongue tip named
T1 through T4, and one coil each was placed on the upper
lip, lower lip, maxillary incisor, and mandible incisor (LJ).
The sampling rate was 250 Hz for the articulatory channels
and 16 kHz for the acoustic channel. Speech materials
comprised 360 Japanese sentences read by three adult male
Japanese speakers at a normal speech rate. The acoustic
data and the articulatory data were recorded simultaneously.
The central point of the phonemes was first labeled
manually, cross-referencing the acoustic cues to the
articulatory cues. The label location was then refined
automatically by finding the steady point of the articulators:
T1 was used for labeling apical consonants, and T3
for the others [11].
3. ANALYSIS OF SPEECH DYNAMICS
We first performed a preliminary analysis to investigate
effects of the individual morphological differences on the
speech dynamics. In the articulatory observation, each
phoneme was represented by a set of vectors with eight
points corresponding to the receiver coils. Phonetically, a
phoneme can be roughly described by a constriction
location in the vocal tract, which is usually caused by a
part of the articulators (cf. [12]). Therefore, it is not always
necessary to account for all the observation points. With
this in mind, we focus on three points in this study: the jaw
(LJ), tongue tip (T1), and tongue dorsum (T3), which were

used to control our physiological articulatory model
[8?10]. These three points are represented in Fig. 1 by
the circles.
3.1. Articulatory Coordinate for Vowels and Consonants
Among the above three points, usually only one is
crucial for constructing a particular phoneme; the other
points are indecisive. Thus, the relation among the
phonemes can be analyzed using a distribution of the
crucial points (CP). In phonetic literature, distribution of
the CPs is commonly described based on isolated utterances.
However, CP distribution can vary during continuous
speech because of coarticulation. This study begins
with an investigation into the distribution of the CPs of the
tongue in continuous speech. Here, T1 is used to define the
CP for ten apical Japanese consonants (including alveolar
and post-alveolar consonants), and T3 is used for vowels
and the palatal consonants /k/ and /g/. The bilabial and
nasal consonants are not dealt with in this paper because
they are anatomically independent of the tongue. The
locations of the CPs were calculated by averaging the
coordinates over a segment of 20 ms, 6 samples of EMA
data surrounding the central point of the phoneme. For each
speaker, the dorsal CP was collected from about 1,600
segments for /a/, 1,200 for /i/, 900 for /u/, 800 for /e/
and 1,200 for /o/. The phoneme number included in this
data set varied from 50 to 300 for the consonants.
Figure 2 shows the mean locations of CP for the vowel
(T3) in the upper panels and for the apical CP (T1) in the
lower panels for three speakers. The coordinates correspond
to those in Fig. 1. The upper case characters denote
the mean location of the CP for vowels and consonants,
which is the average over the selected segments. The main
axis of the scattered CPs, denoted by the lines, was
calculated using a least mean square fitting approach. As
seen in the plots, the mean CPs for both vowels and
consonants have a roughly linear distribution, although the
scattering of the dorsal CPs is wider for speaker MH than
the others, and the scattering of the apical CPs is wider for
TO. The in-line distribution of the CPs in continuous
speech differs significantly from the common distributions
for vowel systems, which have been plotted as a triangular
or trapezoidal shape. This difference can be explained by
the fact that in continuous speech the tongue body moves in
a shortened path to achieve a minimal energy, rather than a
path with an exaggerated triangular distribution seen in
isolated words.
The fitting lines show the main direction of the
movements of the tongue tip and the dorsum. The lines
of the consonantal and vocalic movements have an
intersection with an acute angle by lengthening them in
articulatory space, which is named an articulatory coordinate.
It is interesting to find that the angles between the
directions of the consonantal and vocalic movements are
consistent with one another for all three speakers; angles

were 61, 67, and 68 degrees, respectively. The articulatory
movement of the tongue tip to form an apical CP is heavily
dependent on the individual shape of the hard palate, where
slopes of the anterior portion of the hard palate for the three
speakers ranged from about 10 to 30 degrees referring to
the bite-plate plane. The presence of consistent angles
demonstrates that for a speaker who has a flatter hard
palate, the movement direction of the tongue body is more
tilted in vocalic articulation. This reveals the fact that in
articulation, speakers adjust the position of the CPs to
compensate for morphological differences in their hard
palate shapes. After this compensation, an optimal articulatory
space (the consistent coordinate) is achieved.
In processing such data, the head angle is usually
calibrated using the bite plate to obtain a compatible
coordinate between speakers. Since the shape of the hard
palate was not considered, that calibration is not always
optimal for constructing a compatible coordinate. For
example, the main direction of the CP of the tongue tip lay
almost horizontally for one of the speakers. In that
situation, it was difficult to obtain a reliable correlation
of the vertical and horizontal directions. In contrast, the
proposed articulatory coordinate provides a proper reference
for calibrating the speakersf head during the EMA

experiments. The calibration using the proposed coordinate
derives a maximum projection on the horizontal axis for
both the vocalic and consonantal movements, as shown in
Fig. 2. In the following part of the paper, eehorizontalff and
eeXff indicate the same axis, where the former is mainly
used to describe the spatial relationship and the latter
mainly for the data component. The same distinction is
used for eeverticalff and eeY.ff
3.2. Variation of Articulation and Acoustics
Because of coarticulation, both the left and right
phonemes affect movements of the articulators. For this
reason, phonemes in continuous speech usually show larger
variations in articulatory and acoustic characteristics than
in isolated words. This section investigates the variations in
articulatory and acoustic characteristics of the vowels.
Figure 3 shows the distribution of the tongue dorsum CP
(T3) of five Japanese vowels spoken by one speaker. As
seen in the left panels, the CP during continuous speech
shows a wide distribution in the horizontal dimension,
ranging from 0.9 to 1.4 cm for the five vowels. The vertical
distribution spans less than 0.3 cm for most vowels, while it
is 0.8 cm for /a/. This implies that the tongue moves more
widely in the horizontal dimension than in the vertical.
To examine the relationship between articulatory and
acoustic characteristics, the distribution of the CP is
segmented into nine equal sections in the horizontal
dimension. The appearance frequency of the CPs in each
section is defined by the ratio of the appearance number in
this section to the total number for the vowels, and shown
in the right panels. The black arrows indicate the section
with the highest appearance frequency, and the white
arrows denote the corresponding location of the CPs.
Figure 4 shows the first three formants (F1?F3) of the
vowels, which correspond to the nine sections of the CPs.
The second formant (F2) varies largely with the CP
locations while the first formant (F1) shows little change.
Consistent results were confirmed for the other speakers.
Roughly speaking, F1 mainly corresponds to the degree of
mouth opening, and F2 heavily depends on the anteriorposterior
location of the tongue. The F1 without obvious
changes implies that there are no significant changes in the
degree of mouth opening. This is consistent with one of the
articulatory characteristics for Japanese speakers, where
movements of the lips are relatively small. On the other
hand, the large horizontal movement of the tongue results
in an F2 with a large variation.
4. REGRESSION ANALYSIS OF
COARTICULATION
According to previous studies [1,13], the anticipatory
effects sometimes can span up to three phonemes. For
example, the velum possibly starts moving toward its target
at the third vocalic gesture before a nasal sound. To our
knowledge, there has been no report on the spanning
range of the carryover effects. In past studies [3?5], the
coarticulation was focused on the interval between the
immediately adjacent phonemes. Following those studies,
we consider the effects of vowels on consonants and of
consonants on vowels only for the immediately adjacent
(preceding and following) phonemes. Accordingly, VCV
and CVC sequences were adopted in this study. The
consonants were classified as two groups according to their
CPs: the apical consonants and palatal consonants.
4.1. Analysis Method
From the articulation point of view, the tongue tip and
dorsum can be considered as two independent CPs for
consonants and vowels, respectively. In fact, the movement
region of the tongue tip is constrained by the position of the
dorsum (tongue body), while the dorsum would follow the
tongue tip to construct a constriction at the apex. This
physical connection between the tongue tip and the dorsum
cannot be ignored when examining the relation between the
observation points. For this reason, we consider the spatial
(physiological) constraints of the articulators as well as the
temporal effects of the phoneme sequences in the coarticulation
analysis.
Since there is a high correlation between the jaw and
tongue, and between the tongue tip and dorsum, one
observation point can be described as a function of the
others. Accordingly, the CP coordinates are assumed to be
a linear function of the other factors, and the multiple
regression method is employed to evaluate the contribution
of each factor to the resultant articulatory movement of the
CP. Formulas (1) and (2) describe the X- and Ycomponents
of the CP for the tongue dorsum of the central

for five Japanese vowels.

focus on the central phoneme in the three-phoneme

coefficients for X-components, q is for Y-components,
and c is a constant term. The subscripts j, t, and d denote
the coefficients for the jaw, tongue tip, and tongue dorsum,
respectively. The first line of the formulas is the factors in

variable is T1. The description for T1 is similar to the

In this analysis, the Z-score is used to standardize all
the variables. A backward stepwise regression is employed
to focus on the most significant factors [14]. The processing
starts with all factors and removes the least significant
terms in a stepwise fashion until all the remaining terms are
statistically significant. The probability of the rejection
region F > F was set PdF > FT ? 0:001. The multiple
correlation coefficients with the partial regression coefficients
(PRC) reflect the eecontributionff of each factor to
the target. The PRCs of the formulas (1)?(4) are used to
evaluate the effects of each factor on the CP of the central
phoneme. Note that after using the Z-score the partial
correlation coefficients (PCC) are proportional to the
partial regression coefficients. Therefore, this paper does
not calculate the PCCs directly. The following discussions
concerned with the correlation in the following section
reference to the PRCs.
4.2. Coarticulations within Different Combinations
Three-phoneme sequences of VCV and CVC were
segmented from read sentences. Four combinations were
used in this analysis: apical-vowel-apical (CVC), vowelapical-
vowel (VCV), palatal-vowel-palatal (CVC), and
vowel-palatal-vowel (VCV). The preceding and following
consonants in CVC come out of the same consonant group.
To obtain a reliable relation, the phrase boundaries were
marked and excluded from the VCV and CVC sequences.
The sequences with a pause were also excluded from the
materials for analysis. The data size for each speaker is
about 1,500 sequences for the combinations of vowels and
apical consonants, and about 90 for the combinations of
vowels and palatal consonants. The analysis was first
carried out for three speakers individually. The results
indicated that two speakers had a consistent tendency, but
one speaker showed some differences, especially for the
J. DANG et al.: COARTICULATION IN CONTINUOUS SPEECH
323
VCV sequence with apical consonants. To increase data
size and obtain reliable results, the data from the two
consistent speakers were put together and used in the
following analyses.
4.2.1. Results for apical-vowel-apical sequences
Figure 5 shows the PRCs obtained from 1,169 apicalvowel-
apical (CVC) sequences, where T3 of the central
vowels was described by Eqs. (1) and (2). The multiple
correlation coefficient (MCC) was 0.988 for T3x and 0.956
for T3y, and the average prediction errors were 0.069 cm
and 0.141 cm, respectively. The first eight variables are
concerned with X-components, shown in a dark color,
while the following eight are concerned with Y-components,
shown in a pale color, and the last one shows the
effects of the perpendicular dimension of the same
observation point. The dots indicate that the factors were
removed in the stepwise regression since they were
statistically less significant. The variables starting with
eepff and eefff denote the components of the preceding and
the following phonemes, respectively, and the others show
the components out of the same phoneme to account for
physiological constraints inter and/or intra the articulators.
For T3x on the upper panel, X-components in general
show a definite contribution to T3x, but Y-components do
not show any significant contribution. Among the Xcomponents,
the tongue tip and jaw shows large positive
PRCs. Effects of the preceding phoneme on T3x are
slightly greater than those of the following one. For T3y on
the lower panel, the Y-components show strong effects on
T3y, while the X-components also have comparable effects
with the Y-components. This implies that the dorsum
movement in the Y-dimension strongly depends on the Xcomponents
while the movement in the X-dimension is
almost independent of the Y-components.
During production of the central vowel, T1 and T3
have a higher correlation in the X-dimension but have no
significant correlation in the Y-dimension, which was
removed in the stepwise processing. This implies that the
tongue tip moves consistently with the dorsum in the Xdimension
but independently in the Y-dimension. Moreover,
T3y has a larger negative correlation with T3x,
indicating that the tongue moves in an oblique direction
from front-upper to back-lower.
It is natural to expect that the dorsum may have a
higher correlation to the lower jaw in the Y-dimension than
in the X-dimension. In this figure, however, the LJx has an
extremely high positive correlation with the T3x, which
implies that the movement of the dorsum is constrained by
the jaw in the X-direction more than in the Y-direction. For
the surrounding apical consonants, the PRCs of the jaw to
T3x are negative because the jaw moves in the opposite
directions during the vocalic gesture and the consonantal
gesture.
Both the preceding and following T3s of the apicals
positively contribute to the vocalic target T3. In contrast,
their T1xs negatively contribute to the target T3x. The
positive PRCs reflect the fact that the tongue dorsum
positions of the consonants are strongly dependent on the
adjacent vowels because the apical consonants have no
crucial target for the dorsum. The negative PRCs are
concerned with the movement of the tongue tip for the
apical target, which is opposite to the dorsal movement for
the vocalic target. The opposite motions in the Xdimension
during the apical consonants stretch the tongue
surface to make it flat. This is consistent with the
articulatory observation.
4.2.2. Results for vowel-apical-vowel sequences
Figure 6 shows the PRCs obtained from 3,226 vowelapical-
vowel (VCV) sequences. The crucial point of the
apical consonants, T1, was described by Eqs. (3) and (4).
The MCC was 0.990 for T1x and 0.961 for T1y, and the
prediction errors were 0.064 cm and 0.066 cm, respectively.
As seen in the case of CVC, the X-components play a
dominant role in forming the consonantal target.
To form an apical constriction, the tongue tip moves
forward at the same time the dorsum moves in the same
direction to synergize the tongue tip. This analysis
consistently shows that T3x contributes largely to T1x, as
shown in the upper panel. It is interesting to find that T3y
contributes more to T1x than T1y does. This may be
because in most cases an upward movement of the dorsum
induces a forward movement of the tongue tip, especially
in the vowel-apical-vowel context.
During both preceding and following vowels, the jaw
actively participates in the synergic coarticulation to form
Fig. 5 PRCs for vocalic target T3x (upper) and T3y
(lower) in apical-vowel-apical target. Dots denote the
removal of variables without statistical significance.

the apical gesture since both the X- and Y-dimensions of
the jaw show the positive contribution to T1x. In contrast,
the jaw has negative PRCs during the consonants. The
opposite movement of the jaw to the tongue tip might be
required for forming a wide space in front of the apical
constriction.
Differing from Fig. 5, T1x shows an extremely large
PRC for T1y, while the other variables definitely have
small PRCs. This phenomenon indicates that the vertical
position of the tongue tip depends solely on its horizontal
position. Since the tongue tip contacts the hard palate in the
midsagittal or bilateral part in producing the apicals, for a
given X-position, the Y-position of the tongue is uniquely
determined according to the shape of the hard palate. This
is why the T1y of the apical target depends on its T1x alone.
In contrast, T1y did not show any significant contribution to
T1x, as seen in the upper panel.
In addition, pT1x and f T1x contribute positively to T1x
of the apical consonants, while pT3x and f T3x contribute
negatively. The positive contribution of the tongue tip
results from a synergic action of the surrounding vowels for
forming the apical targets of the consonants. At the same
time, the tongue dorsum moves backward to approach the
vocalic targets. This is why the pT3x and f T3x contribute
negatively to the forward apical movement. The result of
such an opposite motion is that the tongue surface becomes
flatter.
4.2.3. Results for palatal-vowel-palatal sequences
Figure 7 shows the PRCs obtained from 132 palatalvowel-
palatal (CVC) sequences, where the vocalic target
T3 was described by Eqs. (1) and (2). The MCC was 0.990
for T3x and 0.942 for T3y, and the prediction errors were
0.077 cm and 0.109 cm, respectively.
In this combination, vowels and consonants have the
same crucial point, T3. Since the tongue tip does not have a
crucial target, its movements show a good consistency with
those of the tongue dorsum. The result demonstrates that
T1 contributes heavily to T3 in both the X- and Ydimensions.
As seen in the other cases, the X-components
of the independent variables contribute more to T3x than
the Y-components do. The preceding and following
phonemes did not show any superiority of one over
another in their contribution.
Differing from the cases of the apical consonants, the
Y-component of the surrounding palatals does not show
any significant contribution to T3y. This is because the
dorsum always rises at about the same height to contact the
palate during production of the palatal consonants, irrespective
of the height of the dorsum during the vowel. T1y
gives a relatively large contribution to T3y since the tongue
tip and the dorsum drop during the release of the palatal
closure. The contribution of T3x to T3y is greater than that
of T3y to T3x. Again, this implies that the tongue dorsum
moves more actively in the X-dimension than in the Ydimension.
As shown in Fig. 5, the following phoneme
shows stronger effects on the T3y than the preceding one.
4.2.4. Results for vowel-palatal-vowel sequences
Figure 8 shows the PRCs obtained from 772 vowelpalatal-
vowel (VCV) sequences. The MCC was 0.989 for
T3x and 0.921 for T3y, and the prediction errors were
0.076 cm and 0.100 cm, respectively. As seen in Sec. 4.2.3,
T1 has large contributions to the dorsum in both X- and YFig.

dimensions.
In general, X-components of the variables make greater
contributions to T3x than Y-components, which is a
common phenomenon for all the combinations. Both
vocalic T3xs represent positive PRCs for the palatal T3x
because the crucial point of each vowel affects the location
of the dorsal-palatal constriction. The negative PRCs of
vocalic T1x result from the opposite motion of the tongue
tip, which retracts backward during the palatals and
extends forward during the vowels. Retraction of the
tongue tip might be necessary for raising the tongue
dorsum by compressing the tongue body in the anteriorposterior
dimension. The following phoneme obviously
makes larger contributions to the T3y.
In this combination, the jaw and tongue tip work
together to synergize the movement of the dorsum in the Ydimension.
The jaw shows a clear contribution to T3y
during the palatal consonants, which was not seen in the
other combinations. This might suggest that there is a
special requirement for the jaw to generate a synergic
movement in forming the palatal-dorsal closure.
5. EVALUATION OF LR AND RL EFFECTS
To realize coarticulation in an articulatory model, the
left-to-right (LR) effect and the right-to-left (RL) effect
should be investigated separately. The former reflects the
carryover effects of the preceding phoneme on the
following one, whereas the latter corresponds to the
anticipatory effects of the following phoneme on the
preceding one. In this section, we evaluate the LR
(carryover) effect and RL (anticipatory) effect by examining
their relative influences of the preceding and
following phonemes on the central phoneme using the
three-phoneme sequences.
5.1. Method of Evaluation
The basic idea for the evaluation is to quantify the
effects of the lateral phoneme
